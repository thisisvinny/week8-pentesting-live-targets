# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

The response from the login page is different for failed logins using valid usernames as opposed to invalid usernames. For a valid username, such as "jmonroe99", the error is in bold. In addition, the class of the span is "failure". For invalid usernames, such as "thisuernamecannotbetaken", the error is not in bold, and the class of the span is "failed".
